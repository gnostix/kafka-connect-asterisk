Kafka-connect-asterisk is a source [Kafka Connector].(http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect)
We can push data (CDRs, AgentEvents, Call events) from any [Asterisk server](https://www.asterisk.org/) version 1.4 and above to a Kafka topic.

# Development

To build a development version you'll need a recent version of Kafka as well as a set of upstream Confluent projects, which you'll have to build from their appropriate snapshot branch. See the [FAQ](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-jdbc/wiki/FAQ)
for guidance on this process.

You can build kafka-connect-asterisk with Maven using the standard lifecycle phases.(mvn clean package)
